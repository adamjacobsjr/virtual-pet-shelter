# Virtual Pet Shelter

Using most of the same attributes as Virtual-Pet. The constructors are basically the same except a feel like its a cleaner code. 3 attributes are hunger/thirst, boredom, tired. I made Feed and Water 1 attribute because I felt, in general who would feed and water seperately?!. 

Virtual Pet Shelter 

This is where the hash map is and user can interact with them including an add and remove functionality. 
linked to the Virtual Pet class
created gameloop to better understand what loops do what. 

Values and complete list of dinos exists in actualShelter. This was how i set it up to make the add and remove function properly. 

Linked Shelter class to validate the dinos name in the shelter. 

I had originally thought I was going to make an animal shelter but after spending all that time on making the dino ASCII art I changed everything to dino's in the last couple minutes. There are still some animal references but they should not show in the app only in the methods i had already made.
